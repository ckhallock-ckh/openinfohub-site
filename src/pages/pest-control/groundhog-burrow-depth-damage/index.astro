    <h2 style="margin:0 0 8px; font-size:18px;">Direct answer</h2>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      <strong>Groundhog burrows can run several feet deep and extend many feet long with chambers and multiple entrances.</strong>
      The biggest practical problem is not the exact depth. It is the <strong>underground voids and soil movement</strong> they create.
      If a burrow is near or under a <strong>deck, shed, steps, slab, or foundation</strong>, treat it as higher risk and focus on
      <strong>safe removal/exclusion first</strong>, then <strong>proper backfill and compaction</strong>.

  <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px; font-size:18px;">What a groundhog burrow is like</h2>
    <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
      <li><strong>Multiple openings:</strong> often a main entrance plus one or more escape exits.</li>
      <li><strong>Long tunnels:</strong> runs can extend well beyond what you can see from the hole.</li>
      <li><strong>Chambers:</strong> nesting/rest areas and separate side areas can exist inside the system.</li>
      <li><strong>Site choice matters:</strong> edges of lawns, brush lines, and sheltered spaces under structures are common.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px; font-size:18px;">Damage groundhogs can cause</h2>
    <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
      <li><strong>Settlement and sink spots:</strong> voids collapse over time, especially after rain.</li>
      <li><strong>Undermining slabs and steps:</strong> pavers, patios, and walkways can shift as soil moves.</li>
      <li><strong>Deck and shed issues:</strong> burrows near footings or pads can reduce support and create unevenness.</li>
      <li><strong>Trip hazards:</strong> sudden soft spots and holes in lawns.</li>
      <li><strong>Garden damage:</strong> feeding on plants plus soil disturbance around beds.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px; font-size:18px;">What to do (safe order)</h2>
    <ol style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
      <li><strong>Confirm activity:</strong> smooth the dirt at the entrance and check for fresh digging within 24 to 48 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Locate other entrances:</strong> walk the perimeter (fence lines, brush edges, under-deck openings).</li>
      <li><strong>Do not seal an active burrow:</strong> avoid trapping an animal inside or creating odor problems.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove or exclude:</strong> once the animal is out (or removed), block re-entry with heavy-gauge mesh.</li>
      <li><strong>Backfill in lifts and compact:</strong> add soil in layers, compact each layer to reduce future settling.</li>
      <li><strong>Prevent the dig-under comeback:</strong> bury hardware cloth or use an outward L-footer at edges.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px; font-size:18px;">How to backfill correctly (so it does not sink again)</h2>
    <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
      <li><strong>Do it after exclusion:</strong> otherwise they often reopen the same spot.</li>
      <li><strong>Use layers:</strong> backfill in several lifts, not one giant dump of loose soil.</li>
      <li><strong>Compact each lift:</strong> tamp firmly to reduce voids and settling.</li>
      <li><strong>Expect some settling:</strong> plan to top off and reseed after the first rain cycle.</li>
      <li><strong>Watch drainage:</strong> divert downspouts and surface water away from the repaired area.</li>
    </ul>

  <section style="margin-bottom:18px;">
    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px; font-size:18px;">Common mistakes</h2>
    <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
      <li>Sealing or filling a burrow while it is active.</li>
      <li>Assuming there is only one entrance (missed exits = repeat problems).</li>
      <li>Repairing a patio/steps before the burrow is addressed (damage returns).</li>
      <li>Backfilling without compaction (creates future sinkholes).</li>
      <li>Relying on repellents alone after a burrow is established.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:0 0 10px; font-size:18px;">FAQ</h2>

    <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px;">How deep are groundhog burrows?</h3>
    <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
      Depth varies by soil and site, but groundhog burrows commonly run several feet below the surface with tunnels and chambers.
      The bigger practical issue is the <strong>extent</strong> of the system and the voids it creates, especially near structures.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px;">Can a groundhog burrow cause a deck or shed to sink?</h3>
    <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
      Yes. Burrows can create voids that lead to soil settling and loss of support near pads, steps, slabs, and footings.
      If the burrow is under a structure, prioritize safe removal/exclusion and consider professional help.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px;">Is it safe to fill a groundhog hole right away?</h3>
    <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
      Do not fill or seal an active burrow. Confirm the animal is out (or removed), install exclusion to prevent re-entry,
      then backfill and compact properly. Sealing too early can trap an animal and create odor issues.
    </p>

    <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px;">How do I tell if the burrow is active?</h3>
    <p style="margin:0;">
      Fresh digging, a clear open entrance, worn paths, and new disturbance after you smooth the dirt at the entrance (checked within 24 to 48 hours)
      are common signs of activity.
